->Group Project by MENGOZZI Nicolas and AMEUR Oussama

->In order to use the makefile:
	1) "make gfx" will build GfxLib in the GfxLib subfolder
	2) "make" will then build the project files

->The "Playable_Game.rar" archive is a fully user-aimed version of the game without any use of genetic algorithm, which is not the most relevant part of this project.

->The "Report.docx" is the documentation of the project and the several sources used for our project

->The "algogen - commented.c" is just a fully commented version of the algogen file you gave to us during the lessons.

->In some rare cases, the next plateform spawn out of jump range of the players, or the players get stuck. In those case, pressing "R" allow players and platforms to
respawn, without changing the current genomes.
