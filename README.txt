->Group Project by MENGOZZI Nicolas and AMEUR Oussama

->In order to use the makefile:
	1) "make gfx" will build GfxLib in the GfxLib subfolder
	2) "make" will then build the project files

->The "Playable_Game.rar" archive is a fully user-aimed version of the game without any use of genetic algorithm, which is not the most relevant part of this project.

->The "Report.docx" is the documentation of the project and the several sources used for our project

->The "algogen - commented.c" is just a fully commented version of the algogen file you gave to us during the lessons.

Special Keys Control:
	-> Use Q to exit the program

	->Playable Game: Use left an right arrow to move, and the down one to stabilize

	->Genetic Algorithm: Use R to restart the current generation without changing any genome
			     Use K to kill all the players and launch the next generation
